# DocSim3
DocSim3 is a benchmark dataset for evaluating the multilingual semantic similarity of long documents. 

DocSim3 was created based on transforming three Wikipedia-entry based datasets to a dataset that is multilinugal and contains long-documents. The three datasets are:

- [WikipediaSimilarity353 Test Collection](http://community.nzdl.org/wikipediaSimilarity/) [[1]](#1)
- [WikiSRS-similarity and WikiSRS-relatedness](https://github.com/OSU-slatelab/WikiSRS/blob/master/dataset)
